# Assignment-1
The goal of my project: This data analysis is created for the purpose of analyzing how students in different schools like in person-classes and how they like their professors and In person class preference (Yes or No) and How do you like school so far (1-5). The final goal of this project is to find out the correlation between these four variables.

Links to any relevant API documentation: I collected my own dataframe through instagram survey.

The license of your data and any source data: I use the MIT license and no special data source.

A data type and description for each attribute in your data School:
<class 'str'> In person class preference (Yes or No) <class 'str'> How do you like school so far (1-5) <class 'numpy.int64'> Response date <class 'str'> How do you like your professors so far (1-5) <class 'numpy.int64'>

Any known issues or potential issues, such as sources of bias in collection: The "Steps" programs can run perfectly, but some of the practice steps can't, just ignore it I left them there as my notes.
